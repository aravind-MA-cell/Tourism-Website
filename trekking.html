        <p>The Land of Temples is usually not where one would go looking at a shot of adventure, or for that hard-earned gratification and nourishing exhaustion of a long trek. But look closely and you will find hidden deep in the hinterlands, nestled cosily in the lush forests of the Ghats, the innumerable trekking getaways of Tamil Nadu. As they are virtually unknown and underexplored, these pristine sites are the spots where you can be one with nature.</p>
        <h5>Top Trekking Destinations in Tamil Nadu</h5> <br>

Located in the border of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, Mudumalai is easily accessible from both Ooty and Mysore.</p> <br><br>
        <p><strong>Perumal Peak:</strong> A slice of heaven that can be touched only by a trek of approximately 7 km through some steep hills of Western Ghats. Perumal Peak is an astonishing destination for any adventure seeking wayfarers in search of a spot to get a break from the world and to be lost in the middle of a lake of clouds for a few hours. Being 18 km away from Kodaikanal, the peak can be reached easily </p> <br><br>
        <p><strong>Kolli Hills:</strong> Named after the goddess who protected sages residing on the hills from the attack of demons, Kolli Hills is the ideal destination for those in search of an arduous trek and an enthralling view on the way.

        <p><strong>Yelagiri:</strong> A quaint little cluster of 14 villages dotting the hills of the Western Ghats - that is Yelagiri for you.
